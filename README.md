# Hi, I'm Adnilson! 👋

I'm a developer who loves cooking (I've been a professional chef for over a decade, so I know a few tricks), board games, literature and everything artsy. Oh, I also love solving problems with code — that's probably why you're here, right?

## 🚀 About Me

- 🔭 Writing some code in C++ right now
- 🌱 I’m currently learning PostgreSQL
- 💬 Ask me about processes in Linux
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on some small DevOps project (just hit me!)
- ⚡ Fun fact: I was a contributor writer to an italian lifestyle magazine

## 🌱 Currently Exploring

- I’m currently working on a coffee shop database (because who doesn't like coffee, am I right)

 ## 🏆 Achievements

- 🌟 Completed The Reatil Hack 2025 - Built a service that notifies people on expiring products they might be interested in and offered discount in the nearest store. Reduced food waste and encouraged physical presence in the neighborhood.
- 🌟 Built a shell interpreter in C to deeply understand Linux processes, pipelines, and parsing.
